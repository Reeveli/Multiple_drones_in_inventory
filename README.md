# Multiple drones in inventory
This mod adds inventory items that allows you to carry multiple drones in your inventory. No longer do you have to sacrifice your backpack for a drone. You are also able to recover used drones.

This mod adds inventory versions of darter, utility and demining drones for all sides (Blufor, Opfor, Indfor, Civilian)!
