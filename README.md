# Multiple drones in inventory
This mod adds inventory items that allows you to carry multiple drones in your inventory. No longer do you have to sacrifice your backpack for a drone. You are also able to recover used drones (this can only be done if someone is not actively controlling them). Please see the showcase video for more information.

This mod adds inventory versions of Darter, utility, demining drones, remote laser desgnator, Stomper, and Pelter for all sides (Blufor, Opfor, Indfor, Civilian). Additionally if Westren Sahara DLC is active IED and Bsutard drones are also added to all faction (and they have the new mechanics).
